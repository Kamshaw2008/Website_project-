            <p>Hello my name is Kamau. I go to Packer Colligiate Institute in Brooklyn, New york, and i'm going into 10th grade next year. 
            Currenly I am in a summer intensive called All Star Code.  Coding isn't really something I am focused on pursuing in my future 
            but nowadays it is very important to understand code. I have a mom, dad and a younger sister who is in 5th grade.</p>

            <p>I was born in New york. My dad was also born in the U.S, but my mom was born in Guyana and came to the U.S at a very young age. 
            My dads parents were immigrants from Thailand. Even though I was born in America I have a lot of pride for both of my sides.
