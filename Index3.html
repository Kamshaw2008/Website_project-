        <p>For one of my Extra-cirriculars as a freshman this year I was on the JV basketball team. Not only did 
        playing on the basketball team this year help me get better at my main sport, but it also helped with my 
        teamwork skills, and leadership skills.

            <p>Throughout the year I was in two clubs. The first club was The oyster project club. Although I was not able to go much because of basketball
            I was able to learn about how the farming of oyster helps out enviorment. The second club I was in was called swirl. This club
            was an afftinity space for mixed kids to talk about our experiences.
